    <h1>Asymptotic Runtime</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Bubble Sort:</b> Because there are two loops,
            one nested inside the other the time complexity in the average and worst case scenario the
            Asymptotic Runtime is O(n^2) and the best case it would be O(n) if the array is already sorted.</li>
        <li><b>Selected Sort:</b> Like the bubble sort, the selected sort also has nested for loops
            so it also has a time complexity of 0(n^2). The difference is that the Selected Sort will
            perform it's full operation, even if the list is sorted. </li>

    <h1>Explanation of CLIP</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network model developed by
            OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. It is trained on pairs of
            images and text descriptions to learn visual-semantic relationships, allowing it to perform
            various visual recognition tasks without specific training for each task.
